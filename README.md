# x64 Assembly Learning Project for DOS on Intel Processors with TASM

## Description
This project serves as an educational toolkit for those intrigued by x64 Assembly language in a DOS environment, specifically tailored for Intel processors. It's an ideal starting point for beginners to delve into the world of Assembly language, using TASM as the assembler.

## Features
- Introductory examples to x64 Assembly language
- Utilization of DOS interrupts and system calls
- Demonstrations of basic and advanced assembly operations
- Focus on TASM-specific syntax and capabilities

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- An Intel x64 processor
- DOSBox or a comparable DOS emulator
- Turbo Assembler (TASM) for assembling the programs

### Installing
1. Download and set up DOSBox from [the DOSBox website](https://www.dosbox.com/).
2. Obtain TASM and install it in your DOSBox environment. Instructions can typically be found on retro computing forums or archives.
3. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git`.
4. Mount the project directory in DOSBox.

### Executing program
1. Assemble your program in DOSBox using TASM: `TASM yourprogram.asm`.
2. Link the object file to create an executable: `TLINK yourprogram.obj`.
3. Run the executable in DOSBox: `yourprogram.exe`.

## Help
For issues related to TASM syntax or DOSBox configuration, refer to the TASM user guide and DOSBox manual, or visit online forums dedicated to retro computing and assembly language programming.
